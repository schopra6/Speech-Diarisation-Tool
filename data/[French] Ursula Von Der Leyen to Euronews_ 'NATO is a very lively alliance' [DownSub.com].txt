On this issue of the NATO summit next week, Emmanuel Macron 

said that NATO was 'brain dead', do you agree with him?

NATO is a very lively alliance,

 I know it very well.

I think NATO will always be there for collective defence, article 5.

And it is the strongest military alliance in the world. 

So we know that as the European Union 

there are other tasks waiting for us.

That's why we are building up European Defence Union,

it is complementary to NATO but it has a different tasks.

It is remarkable that you've got almost gender parity, in many regards,

but also equally remarkable that there's not  a person of colour in the Commission,

in fact there's never been someone's who's non-white as a commissioner. 

That's pretty shameful isn't it?

I hope that one day this changes, that would be good.

Have you done anything to change it? 

It is the right of the member states to present candidates, 

so I had to fight hard to get the commission composed.

So we'll see.
